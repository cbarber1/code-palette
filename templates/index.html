            <p class="fonts">Generative art refers to art that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system.
            All of the pieces on this website were created using a programming langauge called p5.js, and run in realtime on the browser.
            This means that many of the pieces are interactive, and almost all of them are animated in some way using code.</p>
