<h2> About me </h2>

<p>Hi, my name is Chris Barber and I am a college student studying computer science.
  As you can probably tell, I love creative coding and generative art.
  I just find it fascinating that math and technology and randomness can create something so beautiful.
  I've only been doing generative art for a few months, but I decided to make this website to showcase my pieces along
  with their code which I think is art in itself (not that my code is any good haha). </p>

<p>I started on my generative and creative coding journey through the youtube channel The Coding Train. His videos are absolutely amazing and are great for both beginners and experts alike.</p>

<p>Hope you like it!</p>
